# Neural-Additive-Models
Pytorch implementation of neural additive model

## Description
<p align="justify">
This repository contains Pytorch implementation of neural additive models (NAMs) as previously described in [Agarwal et al.] along its demonstration across four different datasets obtained from <code>responsibly.ai</code> (https://docs.responsibly.ai/index.html)
</p>

These datasets include:
  * COMPAS
  * German Credit Dataset
  * Adults Dataset
  * FICO 

## Installation and running

conda create environment 

## COMPAS


## TODO
    - German Credit Dataset
    - Adults Dataset
    - FICO
